### How do I get set up? ###

This is a project set-up using Grunt. The development use sass and we need to follow this step below:

* install grunt
* cd to your theme folder
* npm install
* grunt

Voila! Now you can edit the custom.scss on SCSS folder and automaticaly compiled to custom.css on CSS folder. Feel free to edit Gruntfile.js if you have additional file to include on this project.
